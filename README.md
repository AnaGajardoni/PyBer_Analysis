## Overview
PyBer is a Python-based ride-sharing App Company that wants to understand how to better serve in regards to affordabilty and coverage.

The following pie charts show clearly that the Urban city holds the most fares, drivers and rides. However, when we correlate  these charts with the following one, we see that(PyBer Ride-Sharing Data), we notice that average fare decreases as the number of drivers increase: it seems that, the more drivers, the more riders, the less the ride will cost.
